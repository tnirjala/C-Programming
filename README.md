Semester 1 - Voting System in C
In the first semester, we created a Voting System using C programming. This project allows users to cast votes for candidates, and the candidate with the maximum votes is declared the winner. We used foundational C concepts such as:
Arrays: For storing and managing candidate and voter information.
Pointers: To handle data efficiently and optimize memory usage.
File Handling: To store votes and results persistently.
Algorithms (Sorting): For organizing and analyzing data.

Semester 2 - Personal Website in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
In the second semester, we developed a static website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This website was our introduction to web development, where we learned key concepts such as:
HTML: Structuring web pages with various elements.
CSS: Styling the layout to enhance the visual appeal.
JavaScript: Adding interactivity and handling basic client-side logic.

Semester 3 - Cafeteria Management System in Java
In the third semester, we explored Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with Java by creating a Cafeteria Management System. This project allowed us to manage orders, calculate bills, and track inventory. We learned several key concepts in Java, including:
Classes and Objects: To structure code and represent real-world entities.
Inheritance and Polymorphism: To enhance code reusability and flexibility.
Exception Handling: To manage errors and ensure a smooth user experience.

Semester 4 - Dynamic eLearning Platform in .NET Web Forms
In the fourth semester, we developed a dynamic eLearning platform using .NET Web Forms. This platform included features such as user registration, course management, and content delivery. Key concepts we applied included:
ASP.NET Web Forms: For creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
Data Binding: To display data efficiently in various components.
State Management: To handle user sessions and maintain data consistency across pages.
