We need to create a voting system that allows voters to select their preferred candidates, with the candidate receiving the highest number of votes being declared the winner, regardless of the percentage of total votes they receive or if they have a majority. 
Our goal is to develop a voting system using the C language that enables voters to choose their preferred candidates.
